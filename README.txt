In terms of this project, the work itself was not too difficult. It was challenging to me because this is one of the first times I've really let a project fall through the cracks. It's been interesting to see how I react to getting a little behind - I let it compound rather than reacting well immediately. As I know how late this is, I mostly just tried to enjoy myself with this. Prolog is cool! Being stressed about not having finished a project (especialy one I know wouldn't take that long) was not! Regardless, it was a good learning experience in terms of CS and in terms of my self.
